        //here we wright javascript code with the methods provided by the socket library that we imported above
        //io is a method available in that library
        //we are making a request from client to the server to open up a web socket and keep that connection open
        //io method returns a connection so we create a variable socket
        //with this variabel socket we can send and receive data to and from server and client
        var socket=io();

        //we are gonna write a function that will fire when client connects to server
        socket.on('connect',()=>{
